# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    
    # Example 1:
    A = [1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1] 
    # Explanation:
    # For instance, if total = 12 then part = 3,
    # one valid split (using 0-indexed boundaries) might be:
    # - First part: A[0..1]         (sum = 1+3=4, so adjust input so that total becomes divisible by 4)
    # Use an input where sum(A) is divisible by 4!
    # For demonstration, let's use an input array where total is divisible by 4.
    
    # Example 2 (designed so total is divisible by 4)
    A = [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]  # total = 10, which is not divisible by 4, so answer=0
    # Letâ€™s use a better array:
    A = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  # total = 8, part = 2.
    # Cumulative sums: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
    # Positions with cum_sum == 2: index 1; 
    # cum_sum == 4: index 3; 
    # cum_sum == 6: index 5.
    # There is only one valid way: first split after index1, second after index3, third after index5.
    
    print(sol.waysToDivideArray(A))  # Output should be 1
