/*Example:

Input: 

    N = 5

    X = [10, 4, 10, 10, 8]

    Y = [2, 2, 1, 9, 6]

Approach:

    If you choose i = 2 and j = 5

    X2 ⊕ X3 ⊕ X4 ⊕ X5 = 4 ⊕ 10 ⊕ 10 ⊕ 8 = 12

    Y2 ⊕ Y3 ⊕ Y4 ⊕ Y5 = 2 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 8 ⊕ 6 = 12

    G = j-i+1 = 5-2+1 = 4

 It can be shown that 4 is the max value possible value of G

 Thus, the answer is 4.*/
