/*You are given an array A. Size = N. You start at index 1 and end at index N. Find the number of ways to reach from index 1 to index N. 

You have to follow some conditions. 

Each number A[i] = 1 or 2 ; if you are at index i you can make a jump of size from range [1â€¦..A[i]] 
You are allowed to jump backwards also but utmost 1 time
